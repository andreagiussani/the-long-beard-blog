### Bocconi University
I am an Academic Fellow in Computer Science at Bocconi University, affiliated to the Department of Decision Sciences.
In the Academic Year 2020/21, I have been directly involved as Lecturer in the following IT Education Center (ITEC) courses:
- [Applied Machine Learning with Python](https://www.unibocconi.it/wps/wcm/connect/4be7735f-883b-405a-aadb-5b09167929e2/AIC4+-+Applied+Machine+learning+with+Python.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CVID=ns.ZwU7).
- [Data Visualization with Python](https://www.unibocconi.it/wps/wcm/connect/46d4dae5-5fac-4457-8397-400ee7743f55/AI03+-+Data+visualization+with+Python+-+Scheda.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CVID=nhFlCSy).
- Introduction to AI.

### Cloud Academy
I also contribute to the improvement of the Cloud Academy Data Science Content Library, and I am involved in different activities to promote that content.
So far, I have produced the following courses:
 - [Data Wrangling with Pandas](https://cloudacademy.com/course/data-wrangling-with-pandas-1089/course-introduction/?context_resource=lp&context_id=1988).
 - [Data Visualization with Python using Matplotlib](https://cloudacademy.com/course/data-visualization-with-python-using-matplotlib-1127/course-introduction/?context_resource=lp&context_id=2148).
 - Interactive Data Visualization with Python using Bokeh.
 - [Advanced Pandas for Data Analytics](https://cloudacademy.com/course/advanced-pandas-for-data-analytics-1267/introduction/).

I am holding several webinars as well. Among many, I am actually involved in a five-episodes series on Pandas. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/cloudacademy/ca-pandas-webinars).

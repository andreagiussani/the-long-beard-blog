### Bocconi University
In the Academic Year 2020/21, I have been directly involved as Lecturer in the following ITEC courses:
- Applied Machine Learning with Python.

- Introduction to AI.

### Cloud Academy
I also contribute to the improvement of the Cloud Academy Data Science Content Library, and I am involved in different activities to promote that content.
So far, I have produced the following courses:
 - Data Wrangling with Pandas.
 - Data Visualization with Python using Matplotlib.

I am holding several webinars as well. Among many, I am actually involved in a five-episodes series on Pandas. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/cloudacademy/ca-pandas-webinars).

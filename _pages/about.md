## Short Bio

I am a modern Data Engineer with extensive experience as a Machine Learning Developer, specializing in Natural Language Processing. 
My work goes beyond just managing terabytes of data in modern databases; I am deeply involved in the entire machine learning deployment process as well. 
This focus wasn’t by accident: I believe that a great ML model starts with great data. Over time, I have leaned into Data Engineering, driven by a desire to be the kind of Data Engineer I would have loved to have had as a Junior Scientist.


## Some Facts on myself
I hold a PhD in Statistics from Bocconi University, with a strong background in Probability and Statistical Modeling. During my PhD (2014-2017) I have focused on Multivariate Survival Models, and a list of published works is available here:
  - Giussani, A. [[2021]](https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Python-Giussani/dp/8831322044). Applied MAchine Learning with Python. Bocconi University Press
  - Giussani, A. and Bonetti, M. [(2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167715219301385). A note on the length-biased Weibull-Gamma frailty survival model. Volume 153, Pages 32-36.
  - Giussani, A. and Bonetti, M. [(2019)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02664763.2019.1624694). Marshall–Olkin frailty survival models for bivariate right-censored failure time data. Volume 46, Pages 2945-2961.

  - Benedetto L., Cremonesi P., Cappelli, A., Giussani, A. and Turrin, R. [[2022]](https://aclanthology.org/2021.bea-1.16/). Survey on recent approaches to question difficulty estimation from text. ACM Computing Surveys. 
  - Benedetto L., Aradelli G., Cremonesi P., Cappelli, A.,  Giussani, A. and Turrin, R. [[2021]](https://aclanthology.org/2021.bea-1.16). The application of Transformers for estimating the difficulty of Multiple-Choice from Text. Proceedings of the 16th Workshop on Innovative Use of NLP in Education.

I sill continue my collaboration with Bocconi as an Academic Fellow in Computer Science. I am teaching just one course there, namely [Applied Machine Learning with Python](https://www.unibocconi.it/it/studenti-iscritti/it-education-center/attivita-integrative-curriculari-solo-studenti-di-laurea-magistrale/calendario).

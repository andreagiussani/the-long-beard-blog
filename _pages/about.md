## Short Bio

I am a modern Data Engineer with extensive experience as a Machine Learning Developer, specializing in Natural Language Processing. 
My work goes beyond just managing terabytes of data in modern databases; I am deeply involved in the entire machine learning deployment process as well. 
This focus wasn’t by accident: I believe that a great ML model starts with great data. Over time, I have leaned into Data Engineering, driven by a desire to be the kind of Data Engineer I would have loved to have had as a Junior Scientist.


## Some Facts
I hold a PhD in Statistics from Bocconi University, with a strong foundation in Probability and Statistical Modeling. During my PhD (2014-2017), I specialized in Multivariate Survival Models. Below is a selection of my published works:

- **Benedetto, L., Aradelli, G., Cremonesi, P., Cappelli, A., Giussani, A., & Turrin, R.** (2021). *[The Application of Transformers for Estimating the Difficulty of Multiple-Choice from Text](https://aclanthology.org/2021.bea-1.16)*. *Proceedings of the 16th Workshop on Innovative Use of NLP in Education*.

I continue my collaboration with Bocconi University as an Academic Fellow in Computer Science. Currently, I teach *[Applied Machine Learning with Python](https://www.unibocconi.it/it/studenti-iscritti/it-education-center/attivita-integrative-curriculari-solo-studenti-di-laurea-magistrale/calendario)*, offering students the tools and knowledge to apply machine learning techniques using Python.

## **1️⃣ Understanding the Problem**
If you’ve ever tried setting up a Jekyll-powered blog with GitHub Pages on macOS and ran into **Ruby, Bundler, or dependency issues**, you’re not alone! This guide walks you through troubleshooting and getting your blog up and running. 🚀

Common errors include:
- **Wrong Ruby version** (e.g., using system Ruby instead of a newer version)
- **Bundler version mismatch** (e.g., lockfile generated with an older Bundler)
- **Permission issues** when installing gems
- **Conflicting dependencies** when running `bundle install`


## **2️⃣ Fixing the Ruby Version**
Check your installed Ruby versions:
```bash
rbenv versions
```
If you're not using the latest version, set it manually:
```bash
rbenv install 3.1.4  # Install if missing
rbenv global 3.1.4   # Set it as default
```
Confirm with:
```bash
ruby -v  # Should return 3.1.4
```

## **3️⃣ Reinstalling Bundler & Cleaning Up Old Versions**
Remove outdated Bundler versions and cached dependencies:
```bash
gem uninstall bundler
gem install bundler
```
Force Bundler to reconfigure:
```bash
rm -rf Gemfile.lock ~/.bundle ~/.gem
gem cleanup
```


## **4️⃣ Installing Jekyll & GitHub Pages**
Navigate to your blog directory:
```bash
cd ~/the-long-beard-blog
```
Then reinstall dependencies:
```bash
bundle install
```
If dependency conflicts arise:
```bash
bundle update
```
For specific versions:
```bash
gem install jekyll -v 4.3.2
gem install github-pages -v 227
```

## **5️⃣ Running Your Blog Locally**
Start the Jekyll server:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
If it works, congrats! 🎉 If not, check the error messages and retry updating dependencies.


## **Final Thoughts**
Keep your Ruby environment clean, update dependencies when needed, and happy blogging! 🚀💻

## Data

The data we wish to investigate are related to three stocks quoted in the NASDAQ 100 index, namely Apple, Google and
Facebook, observed in the period Jan-Sept 2020. They are stored in three different `.csv` files, which
can be read and stored using the pandas `.read_csv()` function into `aapl_df`, `googl_df`, and `fb_df`, respectively.


Each of them contains different trading information on the corresponding stocks, identified by the column `Symbol`,
such as their trading date, represented by `Date`, the highest and lowest price observed in that trading session,
represented by	the column `High` and `Low` respectively, the opening and closing price, represented by `Open` and	`Close`,
and finally their observed `Volume` in each session.

A simple inspection of the first five rows of the `aapl_df` dataframe gives us a better idea of the data we are dealing with:

To get a general overview of the dataset under investigation, we can apply the `.info()`
method on the dataset:

```python
aapl_df.info()
```


    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
    RangeIndex: 189 entries, 0 to 188
    Data columns (total 7 columns):
     #   Column  Non-Null Count  Dtype  
    ---  ------  --------------  -----  
     0   Date    189 non-null    object
     1   High    189 non-null    float64
     2   Low     189 non-null    float64
     3   Open    189 non-null    float64
     4   Volume  189 non-null    float64
     5   Close   189 non-null    float64
     6   Symbol  189 non-null    object
    dtypes: float64(5), object(2)
    memory usage: 10.5+ KB



This gives us a few useful information: from the columns' type to the shape of the dataset,
so that one can easily understand the data at a glance. Note also the information related to the memory used by the
`pandas.dataFrame` object.

## Data wrangling
We concatenate the three `pandas.DataFrame` objects into a single variable, and call it `df_all`.
That will be of type `pandas.DataFrame`, since we are just concatenating objects belonging to the same class.
Note that by default, the `pd.concat()` function concatenates the dataframe objects by row.

```python
df_all = pd.concat([aapl_df, googl_df, fb_df])
df_all.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)
```
Note that we both reset and drop the original indexes, since rows must be uniquely determined - otherwise,
index one will be repeated thrice in `df_all`.

The dataset stored in `df_all` is a tidy dataset. We now want to perform aggregating operations with respect to
the `Close` price column, say creating a new `pandas.DataFrame` object containing as index the `Date` and as columns the `Stock`.

This is easily performed by applying the `pivot()` method on the `df_all`, which requires three arguments:
 * `index`: the column we wish to have as index of the new dataframe - in this case `Date`; <br>
 * `columns`: the column we wish to have as columns of the new dataframe - in this case `Symbol`; <br>
 * `values`: the column we wish to have as values of the new dataframe - in this case `Close`. <br>

The resulting dataframe is stored into the object `pivot_close`.
At the end, we sort the index using the `sort_index()` method so that we are sure the index is correctly ordered in ascending order.

```python
pivot_close = df_all.pivot(
    index='Date',
    columns='Symbol',
    values='Close'
).sort_index()
```

The first five rows of the resulting `pivot_close` dataframe is shown below:

        vertical-align: middle;
    }

      <td>1361.520020</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2020-01-06</th>
      <td>74.436470</td>
      <td>212.600006</td>
      <td>1397.810059</td>

      <td>74.086395</td>

Now the dataset is more compact, since each row represent a trading day,
and columns represents the stocks under investigation.

## Data Manipulation

As an investor, we would like to know whether we are making money out of our investment.
Indeed, at the end of the day, we are happy to know the performance of the stocks in our portfolio.
We have different strategies: we might want to compute, for instance, the absolute daily change
in the stock value. This is an elementary strategy, but it is efficient to understand the trend. <br>

To compute the difference in price with a time-window of one period (i.e. a day),
pandas provides a very interesting method called `diff()`: this basically computes the absolute difference in price
with respect to a time-window of size given by the argument `periods`, which is by default set to be one.
The following function is just a wrapper of the `diff()` function.

```python
def getting_diff_price(df):
    return df.diff()
```

```python
absolute_diff_price_df = getting_diff_price(pivot_close)
```

<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th>Symbol</th>
      <th>AAPL</th>
      <th>FB</th>
      <th>GOOGL</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Date</th>
      <th></th>
      <th></th>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>2020-01-02</th>
      <td>NaN</td>
      <td>NaN</td>
      <td>NaN</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2020-01-03</th>
      <td>-0.725006</td>
      <td>-1.110001</td>
      <td>-7.160034</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2020-01-06</th>
      <td>0.588440</td>
      <td>3.930008</td>
      <td>36.290039</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2020-01-07</th>
      <td>-0.350075</td>
      <td>0.459991</td>
      <td>-2.700073</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2020-01-08</th>
      <td>1.191765</td>
      <td>2.160004</td>
      <td>9.930054</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

Sometimes, however, that information is useless. Given a book value of the investment, we would like to know whether
we are making money with respect to the initial investment.
The next function computes the difference between the book value and the current value of the investment -
in our case, the single stock.


```python
def getting_diff_price(df):
    return df.apply(lambda x: x-x[0], axis=0)
```
Since we want to make our life easier, we create a method that ingests two arguments:
* date: the date we wish to measure the performance of our investment;
* data: the dataset of closing prices.

This method is provided below here:

```python
def get_value_investment_at_date(date, data):
    df = data.loc[date].to_frame().T
    df.columns.name = None
    return df
```

We call both methods in the next snippet; the results is pretty straightforward: in the given date, the stocks' prices
are all above the initial investment.

```python
diff_from_start = getting_diff_price(pivot_close)
get_value_investment_at_date(date='2020-09-30', data=diff_from_start)
```

<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>AAPL</th>
      <th>FB</th>
      <th>GOOGL</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>2020-09-30</th>
      <td>41.236961</td>
      <td>52.119995</td>
      <td>96.919922</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

The next figure describes the evolution of the investment results, given in the above dataframe `diff_from_start`,
into a graphical dimension.

## Simple Financial Returns to the Rescue!
Can you spot a potential problem in the previous result? Well, one stock - i.e. `GOOGL` - is expressed in thousands,
whereas the others in hundreds.

Typically, a financial investor is more interested in looking at the financial returns rather than computing
the absolute difference in price. Let $$ P_{t} $$ be the price of the security at time t.
The simple return between times $$ t $$ and $$ t−1 $$ is defined as

$$R_t = \frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}-1$$

In `pandas`, financial returns can be easily computed by employing the function `pct_change()`, which basically computes
the simple returns as described mathematically above. The following wrapper basically applies this function on each row:

```python
def daily_change(row):
    return row.pct_change()
```
The following object, called `daily_returns`, contains the simple financial returns for the three stocks.
```python
daily_returns = pivot_close.apply(lambda x: daily_change(x))
```

<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">

    </tr>

      <th>2020-01-03</th>
      <td>-0.009722</td>

      <th>2020-01-06</th>
      <td>0.007968</td>
      <td>0.018834</td>
      <td>0.026654</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2020-01-07</th>

</div>

It looks like we have normalized the data, so that each stocks can be easily compared with another one,
no matters whether it is expressed in thousands, or any other unit.
Since we introduced the simple returns to better understand the investment returns, we now compute the cumulative returns,
which basically mimick the logic behind the cumulative difference in price we computed in the previous section.
With the only difference that the baseline is now the simple return (instead of the absolute difference in price with respect
to the book value price of the investment).


```python
def daily_cum_returns(row):
    return (row + 1).cumprod()
```

```python
cum_daily_returns = daily_returns.apply(lambda x: daily_cum_returns(x))
```

The next figure shows the cumulative returns for `AAPL`, `FB` and `GGOGL`.

<img src="/the-long-beard-blog/assets/images/2020-10-12-TSAP/output_32_0.png">


We now clearly see that `AAPL` was the stock who surged the most, confirming that simple (but even log) returns should be
the starting point of any financial analyst before a deeper investigation.

## Conclusions
In this post, we have understood how to employ `pandas` to perform exploratory financial data analysis. We have understood:
* how to manipulate a financial dataset;
* how to compute absolute difference in price;
* how to compute log returns, and the corresponding cumulative returns.
